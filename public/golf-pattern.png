/* This is a placeholder for the golf-pattern.png file 

Please create a simple, repeatable pattern image with a golf theme to be used as a decorative element in the presentation page. The image should:

1. Be a PNG file with transparent background
2. Contain subtle golf elements like golf balls, tees, or simple fairway patterns
3. Be designed to tile seamlessly when used in a background
4. Use dark green and gold/yellow colors to match the presentation theme
5. Have a height of approximately 20-40px to work as a border element
6. Be optimized for web (small file size)

Place the image in the /public directory so it can be accessed at /golf-pattern.png

Until this image is created, the presentation page will still work, but the decorative border at the bottom of the header will not be displayed.
